# SharpRES
Created by: Yamato Nagasaki

- A tool used for basic unpacking and repacking
- It only supports single RES file though, not overall a batch/full unpacking and repacking
- This only supports base game only, DLC is kinda hassle to do and takes time.

Compatible with:
- GOD EATER 2 PSP/Vita (NPJH50832 / PCSG00240)
- GOD EATER 2 RAGE BURST (PCSG00532)
- GOD EATER RESURRECTION (PCSG00719)
- GOD EATER OFFSHOT (PCSG00720 ~ PCSG00725)
